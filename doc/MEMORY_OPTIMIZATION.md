# Memory Optimization Guide for 1GB RAM Devices

## How to Test Memory Usage

### 1. **Using Android Studio Profiler** (Recommended)
1. Connect your device via USB
2. In Android Studio: **View → Tool Windows → Profiler**
3. Run your app and select it in the Profiler
4. Click on **Memory** section
5. Monitor:
   - **Java Heap**: Should stay under 50-100MB for a simple quiz app
   - **Native Heap**: Usually minimal for text-based apps
   - **Graphics**: Should be low (no heavy images)

### 2. **Using ADB Commands** (Command Line)
```bash
# Get memory info for your app
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.javaguiz.app

# Monitor memory in real-time
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.javaguiz.app | grep -E "TOTAL|Java Heap|Native Heap"
```

### 3. **On-Device Testing**
- Install the app on your 1GB RAM device
- Use Developer Options → Memory (if available)
- Monitor with apps like "Memory Monitor" from Play Store

## Current App Analysis

✅ **Good News**: Your app is already memory-efficient:
- No heavy images (only vector drawables)
- Text-based quiz questions
- Simple UI components
- No background services
- No large data structures loaded at once

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. AndroidManifest Optimizations
Added `largeHeap="false"` and memory management settings to prevent excessive memory usage.

### 2. Question Loading Strategy
- Only loads 10 questions at a time (not all 65)
- Questions are simple data objects (low memory footprint)

### 3. Activity Lifecycle
- Activities are properly finished when navigating away
- No memory leaks from listeners

## Memory Usage Estimates

For your quiz app on a 1GB RAM device:
- **App Memory**: ~30-50MB (very lightweight)
- **System Memory**: ~200-300MB (Android OS)
- **Available for Apps**: ~700-800MB
- **Your App Impact**: Minimal ✅

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Install app on 1GB RAM device
- [ ] Run through complete quiz (10 questions)
- [ ] Check for lag or crashes
- [ ] Monitor memory during quiz
- [ ] Test with other apps running in background
- [ ] Test app restart after being killed by system

## Warning Signs

If you see these, you may have memory issues:
- App crashes with "OutOfMemoryError"
- App is killed when switching to another app
- Significant lag when displaying questions
- Memory usage above 100MB for this simple app

## Additional Optimizations (If Needed)

1. **Reduce question count**: Load 5 questions instead of 10
2. **Lazy loading**: Load questions one at a time
3. **Clear references**: Explicitly null large objects when done
4. **Use ProGuard**: Enable code shrinking in release builds

## Tools for Monitoring

1. **Android Studio Profiler** - Best for development
2. **LeakCanary** - Detects memory leaks (add as dependency if needed)
3. **ADB dumpsys** - Command-line memory inspection
4. **Device Settings → Developer Options → Memory** - On-device monitoring
